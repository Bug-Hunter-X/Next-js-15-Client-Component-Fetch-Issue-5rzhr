# Next.js 15 Client Component Fetch Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when performing a fetch request directly within a client component in Next.js 15.  The issue arises when attempting to directly access the data received from the fetch within the component's rendering logic. This can lead to errors or unexpected rendering behaviors. The solution involves using the `use` keyword and performing the fetch within a `useEffect` hook, handling asynchronous data loading appropriately.

## Problem

The initial `about.js` file attempts a direct fetch within the component. This approach fails to properly handle the asynchronous nature of the fetch operation.  The component attempts to render before the data has been received causing unpredictable behavior, specifically in how Next.js handles data fetching in client components.
